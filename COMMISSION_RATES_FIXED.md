# Issue #3 COMPLETE: Commission Rates Fixed

## ‚úÖ Problem Solved

### What Was Wrong
The system was importing commission calculations from the **WRONG FILE**:
- ‚ùå **Used**: `server/utils/commission.ts` (placeholder rates $30-$50)
- ‚úÖ **Now Using**: `server/commissionCalculator.ts` (actual rates $9-$40)

### The Fix
**File**: `server/routes.ts` (Line 6-10)
```typescript
// Changed from:
import { calculateCommission, getPlanTierFromName, getPlanTypeFromMemberType } from "./utils/commission";

// To:
import { calculateCommission, getPlanTierFromName, getPlanTypeFromMemberType } from "./commissionCalculator";
```
