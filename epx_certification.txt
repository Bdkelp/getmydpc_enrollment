Introduction  
Purpose  of  this  document  
This
 
document
 
certifies
 
the
 
completed
 
integration
 
of
 
said
 
merchant
 
and
 
authorizes
 
the
 
merchant
 
to
 
process
 
the
 
specified
 
transactions
 
against
 
the
 
Electronic
 
Payment
 
Exchange
 
(EPX)
 
platform.
 
This
 
document
 
also
 
contains
 
the
 
production
 
URLs
 
and
 
credentials
 
for
 
processing
 
against
 
the
 
EPX
 
production
 
environment.
 
 
It
 
is
 
imperative
 
that
 
the
 
client
 
uses
 
the
 
production
 
credentials
 
when
 
pointing
 
to
 
the
 
production
 
URL(s).
  
In
 
no
 
way
 
should
 
the
 
client
 
attempt
 
to
 
use
 
UAP/Test
 
URL(s)
 
and/or
 
credentials
 
within
 
our
 
production
 
environment
 
or
 
vice
 
versa.
  
 
If
 
said
 
merchant
 
intends
 
to
 
implement
 
other
 
transaction
 
types
 
for
 
processing
 
in
 
the
 
live
 
environment,
 
EPX
 
requires
 
the
 
merchant
 
to
 
complete
 
certification
 
of
 
each
 
additional
 
transaction
 
type
 
against
 
the
 
test
 
environment
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
transactions
 
in
 
the
 
live
 
environment.

EPX  DNS  and  IP  Addresses  
When
 
connecting
 
to
 
EPX,
 
always
 
use
 
the
 
DNS
 
rather
 
than
 
the
 
IP
 
address.
 
Redundancy
 
on
 
the
 
EPX
 
side
 
ensures
 
an
 
easy
 
change
 
of
 
Internet
 
Service
 
Providers
 
(ISPs)
 
should
 
an
 
issue
 
occur.
 
EPX
 
uses
 
a
 
short
 
time
 
to
 
live
 
(TTL)
 
on
 
the
 
DNS
 
values
 
so
 
that
 
within
 
seconds
 
we
 
can
 
change
 
the
 
IP
 
behind
 
the
 
DNS
 
entry
 
when
 
it
 
is
 
necessary.
 
 
NOTE:
 
EPX
 
is
 
not
 
responsible
 
for
 
any
 
merchant
 
connectivity
 
issues
 
if
 
the
 
merchant
 
ignores
 
the
 
requirement
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
DNS.
 
In
 
some
 
cases,
 
the
 
merchant
 
has
 
a
 
firewall
 
in
 
their
 
environment
 
that
 
is
 
blocking
 
access
 
to
 
EPX.
 
In
 
this
 
scenario,
 
the
 
merchant
 
must
 
add
 
a
 
specific
 
range
 
of
 
IPs
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
EPX
 
smart
 
DNS
 
can
 
work
 
effectively
 
and
 
the
 
merchant
 
is
 
not
 
restricted
 
to
 
only
 
one
 
EPX
 
IP
 
address.
 
The
 
IP
 
address
 
ranges
 
that
 
the
 
EPX
 
payment
 
services
 
utilize
 
are
 
listed
 
below.
 
In
 
very
 
infrequent
 
situations,
 
EPX
 
services
 
may
 
need
 
to
 
communicate
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
merchant
 
site;
 
in
 
these
 
instances,
 
the
 
specific
 
outbound
 
IP
 
addresses
 
that
 
may
 
be
 
used
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
current
 
EPX
 
ISP
 
are
 
listed
 
below.
