## ðŸš€ **How to Test:**

### **Option 1: Using Browser**
1. Open your Railway app URL
2. Add `/api/test-commission-count` to see current count
3. Use a tool like Postman to POST to `/api/test-commission`
4. Check count again to see if it increased

### **Option 2: Using curl (if available)**
```bash
# Check current count
curl https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api/test-commission-count

# Create test commission  
curl -X POST https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api/test-commission

# Check count again
curl https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api/test-commission-count
```

### **Option 3: Real Enrollment Test**
1. Go to your enrollment form
2. Complete a test enrollment with an agent assigned
3. Check if commission appears in `agent_commissions` table
4. Verify both old and new tables get the commission (dual-write)
