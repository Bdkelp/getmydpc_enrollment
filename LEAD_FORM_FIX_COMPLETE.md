# ✅ LEAD FORM FIX - COMPLETE AND TESTED

## Problem Solved
Your public contact form was failing with the error:
```
Database error: Could not find the 'source' column of 'leads' in the schema cache
```

## Root Cause
The code was trying to insert columns that **don't exist** in your Supabase `leads` table:
- ❌ `source` - doesn't exist
- ❌ `assigned_agent_id` - doesn't exist  
- ❌ `notes` - doesn't exist
- ❌ `updated_at` - doesn't exist

## Fix Applied ✅

Updated `server/storage.ts` `createLead()` function to **ONLY** insert columns that exist:
- ✅ `first_name`
- ✅ `last_name`
- ✅ `email`
- ✅ `phone`
- ✅ `message`
- ✅ `status`
- ✅ `created_at` (auto-generated)

## Test Results ✅

```
✅ Lead created successfully!
   Lead ID: 3
   Name: John Doe
   Email: johndoe@example.com
   Status: new
```

**The fix has been tested and works perfectly!**

## What Happens Now

Your public contact form will:
1. ✅ Accept submissions from visitors
2. ✅ Save: name, email, phone, message, status='new'
3. ✅ Show up in your admin leads panel
4. ✅ Work immediately after deployment

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit the code changes:**
   ```bash
   git add server/storage.ts
   git commit -m "Fix lead form - remove non-existent columns"
   git push
   ```

2. **Railway will auto-deploy** (or manually trigger deploy)

3. **Test the public contact form** on your website

4. **Verify leads appear** in admin dashboard

## What's Missing (Optional for Later)

Your leads table is functional but missing these optional columns:
- `source` - track where leads come from
- `assigned_agent_id` - assign leads to specific agents
- `notes` - add notes about leads
- `updated_at` - track when leads are modified

**You don't need these right now!** The basic form works without them.

If you want to add them later, run the SQL file: `add_missing_leads_columns.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

## Summary

- ✅ **Problem:** Code tried to insert non-existent columns
- ✅ **Solution:** Only insert columns that exist
- ✅ **Tested:** Successfully created and retrieved lead
- ✅ **Status:** Ready to deploy and use!

## Next Action

**Deploy to Railway** and your public contact form will work! 🎉

The error is completely fixed now. Visitors can submit leads through your website contact form, and they'll be saved to your database successfully.
