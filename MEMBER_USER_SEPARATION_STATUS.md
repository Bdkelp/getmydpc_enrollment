# Member/User Separation - Current Status

## üìã Executive Summary

**Goal:** Separate enrolled healthcare members (customers) from authenticated users (agents/admins)
- **Users** = Agents and admins with login access to the app
- **Members** = Enrolled healthcare customers (NO login access, data only)

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

### 1. Database Schema (‚úÖ DONE)
- **`members` table created** in `shared/schema.ts`
  - Stores enrolled healthcare customers
  - Includes customer_number, personal info, employment data
  - Has enrollment tracking (enrolled_by_agent_id, agent_number)
  - Separate from authentication system

- **Related tables updated** to reference members:
  - `subscriptions` - has `member_id` field (nullable)
  - `payments` - has `member_id` field (nullable)
  - `commissions` - has `member_id` field (nullable)
  - `family_members` - has `primary_member_id` field (nullable)

### 2. Migration Scripts (‚úÖ DONE)
- **`member_user_separation_migration.sql`** - Full production migration script
- **`MEMBER_USER_SEPARATION_PLAN.md`** - Complete implementation plan
- **`DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_MEMBER_SEPARATION.md`** - Step-by-step deployment guide

### 3. Documentation (‚úÖ DONE)
- Clear separation documented
- Migration path defined
- Rollback procedures created
- Testing checklist prepared

## ‚ùå What's NOT Complete

### 1. Database Migration (‚ùå NOT RUN)
**Status:** Migration script exists but **HAS NOT been executed** on production database

**Evidence:**
- `server/storage.ts` still queries `users` table for members:
  ```typescript
  WHERE u.role IN ('user', 'member')  // Still using users table!
  ```
- No `members` table data being queried
- Subscriptions still link to `user_id` not `member_id`

**What needs to happen:**
```sql
-- Run the migration script to:
-- 1. Create members table in database
-- 2. Copy member records from users table
-- 3. Update all foreign key references
-- 4. Delete member records from users table
```

### 2. Code Updates (‚ùå NOT COMPLETE)
**Status:** Code still treats members as users with a role

**Files that need updating:**

#### `server/storage.ts`
Currently:
```typescript
// ‚ùå Still using users table for members
export async function getMembersOnly() {
  const usersResult = await query(
    `SELECT u.* FROM users u
     WHERE u.role IN ('user', 'member')`  // WRONG!
  );
}
```

Should be:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Use members table
export async function getMembersOnly() {
  const membersResult = await query(
    `SELECT m.* FROM members m
     WHERE m.is_active = true
     ORDER BY m.enrollment_date DESC`
  );
}

// ‚úÖ Add member-specific functions
export async function createMember(data: MemberData) {
  // Insert into members table (NO Supabase auth)
}

export async function getMember(id: number) {
  // Query members table
}

export async function updateMember(id: number, data: Partial<MemberData>) {
  // Update members table
}
```

#### `server/routes.ts`
Currently:
```typescript
// ‚ùå Registration creates users with "member" role
router.post('/api/registration', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await storage.createUser({
    role: 'member',  // WRONG!
    ...
  });
});
```

Should be:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Registration creates members (no auth)
router.post('/api/registration', async (req, res) => {
  const member = await storage.createMember({
    // NO Supabase auth creation!
    // NO role field
    ...
  });
});
```

#### Authentication Middleware
Currently:
```typescript
// ‚ùå Allows member logins
if (user.role === 'member') {
  // Members can still potentially log in
}
```

Should be:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Block member emails from logging in
if (user.role !== 'agent' && user.role !== 'admin' && user.role !== 'super_admin') {
  throw new Error('Only agents and admins can log into this application');
}

// ‚úÖ Check if email belongs to a member
const member = await storage.getMemberByEmail(email);
if (member) {
  throw new Error('Members cannot log into this application. Please contact your agent.');
}
```

### 3. Frontend Updates (‚ùå NOT COMPLETE)
**Status:** UI still shows "Users" and allows member logins

**Files that need updating:**

#### `client/src/pages/admin.tsx`
- Change "Users" to "Agents" and "Members" tabs
- Show different columns for each
- Remove "Login" column from members view

#### `client/src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`
- Add check to block member emails from logging in
- Show appropriate error message

#### Registration Forms
- Update to create members, not users
- Remove any authentication-related fields

## üìä Current Data State

### Users Table
**Currently contains:**
- Agents (role = 'agent')
- Admins (role = 'admin')  
- Super Admins (role = 'super_admin')
- **‚ùå MEMBERS (role = 'member' or 'user')** ‚Üê Should NOT be here!

### Members Table
**Currently contains:**
- **‚ùå EMPTY** - Migration hasn't been run

## üéØ What Needs to Happen Next

### Phase 1: Database Migration (1-2 hours)
```bash
# 1. Backup database
pg_dump DATABASE_URL > backup_before_member_separation.sql

# 2. Run migration
psql DATABASE_URL -f member_user_separation_migration.sql

# 3. Verify migration
psql DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM members;"  # Should show ~70-85 records
psql DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY role;"  # Should only show agent/admin
```

### Phase 2: Update Storage Layer (2-3 hours)
1. Add `createMember()`, `getMember()`, `getMemberByEmail()`, `updateMember()` functions
2. Update `getMembersOnly()` to query `members` table
3. Update enrollment functions to create members, not users
4. Update all queries joining subscriptions/payments to use member_id

### Phase 3: Update API Routes (2-3 hours)
1. `/api/registration` - create member instead of user
2. `/api/agent/enrollment` - create member instead of user
3. `/api/admin/members` - query members table
4. Block member emails from `/api/auth/login`

### Phase 4: Update Frontend (1-2 hours)
1. Separate "Agents" and "Members" tabs
2. Update auth hook to block member logins
3. Fix terminology throughout UI

### Phase 5: Testing (2-3 hours)
1. Test agent login ‚úì
2. Test admin login ‚úì
3. Test member email BLOCKED from login ‚úì
4. Test member enrollment ‚úì
5. Test member data display ‚úì
6. Test subscriptions linked correctly ‚úì
7. Test commissions tracked correctly ‚úì

## üö® Why This Matters

### Security Issues (Current State)
- ‚ùå Members have user accounts (potential login access)
- ‚ùå Member emails exist in Supabase Auth
- ‚ùå No clear separation of concerns
- ‚ùå Confused data model (user vs member)

### Benefits (After Migration)
- ‚úÖ Members **CANNOT** log into the app
- ‚úÖ Clear separation: users = staff, members = customers
- ‚úÖ Better HIPAA compliance
- ‚úÖ Reduced attack surface
- ‚úÖ Cleaner codebase
- ‚úÖ Easier to maintain

## üìù Decision Required

**Do you want to proceed with the migration?**

Options:
1. **Run the migration now** - Complete the separation
2. **Test migration on copy first** - Safer approach
3. **Wait** - Keep current mixed approach

The migration script and plan are **ready to execute** - we just need to pull the trigger.

**Status:** Schema ready, migration scripts ready, code updates needed
**Blocker:** Migration has not been executed on production database
