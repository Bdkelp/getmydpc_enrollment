## Commission Examples

### Example 1: Base Plan - Member Only
- Base Commission: $9.00
- With RxValet: $9.00 + $2.50 = $11.50

### Example 2: Plus Plan - Member + Spouse
- Base Commission: $40.00
- With RxValet: $40.00 + $2.50 = $42.50

### Example 3: Elite Plan - Family
- Base Commission: $40.00
- With RxValet: $40.00 + $2.50 = $42.50

## How It Works in the System

1. **Automatic Calculation**: When an agent enrolls a member, the system automatically calculates the commission based on:
   - Plan tier (Base, Plus, or Elite)
   - Member type (Member only, Mem/Spouse, Mem/Children, Family)
   - Whether RxValet is included

2. **Real-time Tracking**: The agent dashboard shows:
   - Total commission earned
   - Monthly commission
   - Commission per enrollment

3. **CSV Export**: When exporting enrollments, the commission column shows the calculated amount for each enrollment

## Important Notes

- Commissions are calculated per enrollment, not per member
- Family plans with multiple members still count as one enrollment
- The system automatically handles variations in member type naming (e.g., "Member/Spouse" and "Mem/Spouse")
- All commission amounts are in USD

## Testing the New Structure

To verify the commission calculations:
1. Log in as an agent
2. View the dashboard to see total commissions
3. Check individual enrollments for correct commission amounts
4. Export enrollments to CSV to verify commission calculations
