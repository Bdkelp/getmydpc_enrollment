# Deployment Options for MyPremierPlans Enrollment Platform

## Option 1: Subdirectory on Existing Site (Recommended)

### Advantages
- **No additional domain cost**
- **SEO benefits** - Inherits domain authority from mypremierplans.com
- **Easier management** - Single SSL certificate, single DNS setup
- **Better user trust** - Users stay on the familiar mypremierplans.com domain
- **Simple implementation** - Can be deployed as a subdirectory or subdomain

### Implementation Options

#### A. Subdirectory: mypremierplans.com/enrollment
- Best for SEO (shares domain authority)
- Requires reverse proxy configuration on main site
- URL structure: 
  - Landing: mypremierplans.com/enrollment
  - Registration: mypremierplans.com/enrollment/registration
  - Admin: mypremierplans.com/enrollment/admin

#### B. Subdomain: enrollment.mypremierplans.com
- Easier to implement technically
- Separate deployment but same domain
- Can use different hosting if needed
- Still benefits from main domain trust

## Option 2: Separate Domain

### When to Consider
- If you want complete separation from main site
- For testing/staging environments
- If main site cannot accommodate the app

### Disadvantages
- Additional domain cost (~$10-20/year)
- Separate SSL certificate needed
- No SEO benefit from main domain
- Users might be confused by different domain

## Recommended Approach

**Use mypremierplans.com/enrollment** for production because:

1. **Cost Efficiency**: No additional domain purchase
2. **User Experience**: Seamless experience on familiar domain
3. **SEO Value**: Benefits from existing domain authority
4. **Trust**: Users trust the main mypremierplans.com domain
5. **Maintenance**: Single domain to manage

## Deployment Steps for Subdirectory

### On Replit:
1. Deploy the application using Replit's deployment
2. Note the deployment URL (e.g., your-app.replit.app)

### On Your Main Site:
1. Configure reverse proxy to route /enrollment/* to your Replit app
2. Update any absolute URLs in the app to use relative paths
3. Configure CORS if needed

### Example Nginx Configuration:
```nginx
location /enrollment {
    proxy_pass https://your-app.replit.app;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

## Environment Variables for Production

When deploying, ensure these are set:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe secret key
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` - Stripe publishable key
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Secure session secret
- `PUBLIC_URL` - Set to https://mypremierplans.com/enrollment

## Testing Before Launch

1. Test all enrollment flows
2. Verify payment processing
3. Check agent/admin access
4. Test on mobile devices
5. Verify SSL certificate
6. Test form submissions

## Future Considerations

As you scale:
- Consider CDN for static assets
- Monitor performance metrics
- Set up error tracking
- Configure automated backups
- Plan for load balancing if needed

The subdirectory approach (mypremierplans.com/enrollment) provides the best balance of cost, user experience, and technical simplicity for your DPC enrollment platform.
