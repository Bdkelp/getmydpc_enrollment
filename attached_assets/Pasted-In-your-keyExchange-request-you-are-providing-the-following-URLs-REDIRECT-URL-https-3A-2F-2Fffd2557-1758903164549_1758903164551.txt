In your keyExchange request you are providing the following URLs: REDIRECT_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fffd2557a-af4c-48a9-9a30-85d2ce375e45-00-pjr5zjuzb5vw.worf.replit.dev%2Fpayment%2Fsuccess&RESPONSE_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fffd2557a-af4c-48a9-9a30-85d2ce375e45-00-pjr5zjuzb5vw.worf.replit.dev%2Fapi%2Fepx%2Fwebhook&CANCEL_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fffd2557a-af4c-48a9-9a30-85d2ce375e45-00-pjr5zjuzb5vw.worf.replit.dev%2Fpayment%2Fcancel

after URL decode they look like:

https://ffd2557a-af4c-48a9-9a30-85d2ce375e45-00-pjr5zjuzb5vw.worf.replit.dev/payment/success
https://ffd2557a-af4c-48a9-9a30-85d2ce375e45-00-pjr5zjuzb5vw.worf.replit.dev/api/epx/webhook
https://ffd2557a-af4c-48a9-9a30-85d2ce375e45-00-pjr5zjuzb5vw.worf.replit.dev/payment/cancel

This is completely different from what you have provided below:

Redirect URL:
https://enrollment.getmydpc.com/api/epx/redirect
Response URL:
https://enrollment.getmydpc.com/api/epx/webhook
Cancel URL:
https://enrollment.getmydpc.com/api/epx/redirect?status=cancelled

Please note that CANCEL_URL is not a valid field for the Browser Post API and the RESPONSE_URL is not stored on the EPX side. The only URL we need to store is the REDIRECT_URL. Please advise which is the correct REDIRECT_URL so we can make the update on our end.
