I can see the issue! You have the keyExchange working perfectly, but the problem is with the redirect endpoint. The 404 error on /api/epx/redirect indicates that when EPX tries to redirect back to your app after processing the payment, it can't find the handler.
Let me help you debug this:
Immediate Issues to Check:
1. Missing Transaction POST Logging
Your logs show the connectivity test (keyExchange) but not the actual transaction POST that should happen during a real payment flow. We need to capture that.
2. Redirect Handler Issue
The 404 suggests your redirect endpoint isn't properly set up or there's a routing issue.
Let me search for your EPX route handlers to see the current implementation:Searched for “EPX payment redirect handler route implementation code”0 resultsSearched for “EPX payment processing route handlers server code”0 resultsDebugging Steps:
1. Check your redirect route implementation
In your server code, make sure you have a proper handler for the redirect:
javascript// Should be something like this in your EPX routes
app.get('/api/epx/redirect', (req, res) => {
  console.log('[EPX Redirect] Received redirect from EPX');
  console.log('[EPX Redirect] Query params:', req.query);
  console.log('[EPX Redirect] Body:', req.body);
  
  // Handle the EPX response here
  res.redirect('/confirmation?status=success'); // or wherever you want to send users
});
2. Add Transaction POST logging
To capture the missing transaction POST data, add this to your payment creation endpoint:
javascript// In your create-payment endpoint, after generating TAC
console.log('[EPX] === RAW TRANSACTION POST ===');
console.log('[EPX] URL: https://services.epxuap.com/browserpost/');
console.log('[EPX] Method: POST');
console.log('[EPX] Payment Form Data:', paymentFormData);
console.log('[EPX] === END TRANSACTION POST ===');
3. Test the redirect endpoint directly
Try visiting: https://enrollment.getmydpc.com/api/epx/redirect?test=1
If it gives 404, then the route isn't registered properly.
Quick Fix Options:

Check if the route is properly registered - Your logs show it should be there: [EPX Routes] - GET /api/epx/redirect
Check for URL mismatch - Make sure the redirect URL in your EPX config matches exactly what EPX is trying to call
Add a catch-all handler temporarily:

javascriptapp.all('/api/epx/*', (req, res) => {
  console.log('[EPX] Catch-all hit:', req.method, req.url);
  console.log('[EPX] Params:', req.params);
  console.log('[EPX] Query:', req.query);
  console.log('[EPX] Body:', req.body);
  res.json({ received: true, method: req.method, url: req.url });
});
