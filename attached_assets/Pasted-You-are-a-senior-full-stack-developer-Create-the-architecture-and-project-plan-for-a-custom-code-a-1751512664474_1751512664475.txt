You are a senior full-stack developer. Create the architecture and project plan for a custom, code-accessible online subscription and enrollment platform for a Direct Primary Care (DPC) provider, MyPremierPlans (MPP). The system must be built to support full access to all source code for internal tech staff to modify, debug, and update as needed. No closed-source, proprietary platforms or “black box” systems.

Key Requirements:

Enrollment Flows:

1. Agent-assisted individual enrollments (agent inputs member data).


2. Agent-assisted group enrollments (employers or agents enroll groups via code or census).


3. Self-enrollment for individuals (no agent needed).



User & Platform Features:

User registration with email or SMS verification before accessing subscription options.

Secure collection of:

Personal info

Plan selection

Payment info (monthly recurring billing required)


Real-time payment processing using Stripe or similar (PCI compliant).

Monthly billing cycle with the ability to upgrade/downgrade/cancel plans.

Agent dashboard with member tracking and reporting (including commissions).

Employer dashboard for managing group enrollees.

Company admin panel with full access to data, reports, user management, and system config.


Development Requirements:

Full access to readable, editable source code.

Git-based version control (private repo, e.g., GitHub/GitLab).

Modular codebase with clean structure for easy updates.

Tech stack should support both self-hosted (Docker/K8s) and cloud-hosted (AWS/Azure) deployment.

Include documentation for:

API endpoints

Frontend/backend components

Setup and deployment

Maintenance and error handling



Security & Compliance:

HIPAA compliance for medical data.

PCI-DSS compliance for payment processing.

Role-based access control for agents, employers, and admins.
