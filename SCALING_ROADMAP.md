# DPC Platform Scaling Roadmap

## Current Status (Phase 1)
- Agent-only enrollment system
- <10 agents for initial testing
- Lead capture via contact form
- Mock payment system for testing

## Phase 2: Enable Self-Enrollment (Timeline: After Testing)

### Database Changes Needed
```sql
-- Add to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN enrollment_source VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'agent';
-- Values: 'agent', 'self', 'admin', 'import'

ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN enrollment_date TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN referring_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN utm_source VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN utm_campaign VARCHAR(100);
```

### Code Changes for Self-Enrollment

1. **Update Registration Flow**
```typescript
// Add to registration.tsx
const isAgentEnrollment = user?.role === 'agent' || user?.role === 'admin';
const enrollmentSource = isAgentEnrollment ? 'agent' : 'self';

// Track in submission
const registrationData = {
  ...formData,
  enrollmentSource,
  enrolledByAgentId: isAgentEnrollment ? user.id : null,
  enrollmentDate: new Date()
};
```

2. **Add Self-Service Dashboard**
```typescript
// New dashboard for self-enrolled users
// - View their plan details
// - Update payment method
// - Download documents
// - View billing history
// - Request plan changes (routes to agent)
```

3. **Modify Access Control**
```typescript
// Update routing logic
if (user.role === 'user') {
  if (user.enrollmentSource === 'self') {
    return <SelfServiceDashboard />;
  } else {
    return <ContactAgentPage />;
  }
}
```

## Phase 3: Scale to Hundreds of Agents

### 1. Agent Management System
```typescript
// New features needed:
- Agent onboarding workflow
- Agent performance dashboard
- Territory/region assignment
- Commission tiers based on volume
- Agent training modules
- Automated agent reports
```

### 2. Performance Optimizations
```typescript
// Database indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_enrolled_by_agent ON users(enrolled_by_agent_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_enrollment_date ON users(enrollment_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_agent_performance ON users(enrolled_by_agent_id, enrollment_date);

// Caching layer
- Redis for session management
- CDN for static assets
- Query result caching
```

### 3. Multi-Tenant Features
```typescript
// Agent white-labeling
- Custom agent landing pages
- Personalized enrollment URLs
- Agent-specific branding options
- Custom email templates per agent
```

### 4. Advanced Analytics
```typescript
// New analytics needs:
- Agent leaderboards
- Conversion funnel by source
- Geographic heat maps
- Cohort retention analysis
- Commission forecasting
- A/B testing framework
```
