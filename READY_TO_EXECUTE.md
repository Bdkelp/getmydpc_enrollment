```
=============================================================
STEP 1: PRE-CLEANUP VERIFICATION
=============================================================

=============================================================

‚úÖ PASS - Exactly 20 subscriptions remain
‚úÖ PASS - No orphaned payments
‚úÖ PASS - No orphaned commissions

‚úÖ CLEANUP COMPLETE AND VERIFIED!
```

#### Option B: One-Time Command (Alternative)

If Railway has a "Run Command" feature:
1. Look for **"‚ãØ"** (three dots) menu on your service
2. Select **"Run Command"** or **"Execute"**
3. Type: `node run_cleanup.js`
4. Press Enter
5. Watch output

---

### **STEP 4: Restore Normal Operation**

After cleanup completes successfully:

1. Go back to **"Settings"** tab
2. Find **"Custom Start Command"**
3. **Delete the custom command** or change back to: `npm run start`
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Go to **"Variables"** tab
6. Find `CONFIRM_CLEANUP`
7. Click **"Delete"** (trash icon)
8. Railway will redeploy with normal start command

---

### **STEP 5: Verify Your App Works**

1. Go to **enrollment.getmydpc.com**
2. Log in as an agent
3. Check the enrollments list
4. Verify you see the 20 most recent enrollments
5. Test that everything works normally

---

### **STEP 6: Clean Up the Script**

Once verified, remove the cleanup script from your repo:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Aarons\OneDrive\Desktop\landing pages\lonestarenotary-repo\getmydpc_enrollment"

git rm run_cleanup.js
git commit -m "Remove cleanup script after successful execution"
git push origin main
```

**Why?** Security - don't leave database modification scripts in production code.

---

## üìä What to Expect

### Before Cleanup:
- ~81 member users
- ~65 subscriptions
- Lots of test data

### After Cleanup:
- **Exactly 20 subscriptions** (newest ones)
- Related payments/commissions for those 20
- All agents/admins preserved
- EPX can see their 20 transactions

---

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

After running, verify:
- [ ] Railway logs show "‚úÖ CLEANUP COMPLETE AND VERIFIED!"
- [ ] Exactly 20 subscriptions remain
- [ ] No orphaned records (0 for both checks)
- [ ] App loads normally
- [ ] Can see enrollments in dashboard
- [ ] EPX can view their transactions

## üÜò Troubleshooting

‚Üí You forgot to add the environment variable in Step 2

### "Cleanup not needed (‚â§20)"
‚Üí You already have 20 or fewer subscriptions, cleanup not needed

### Can't find Railway logs
‚Üí Deployments tab ‚Üí Click deployment ‚Üí View Logs button

### Need to undo?
‚Üí Railway dashboard ‚Üí Find database backup/restore feature
‚Üí Or contact me for rollback help
