# How to Access Your Neon Database

## üéØ Your Situation
- Replit automatically set up Neon for you
- You've never logged into Neon directly
- The DATABASE_URL is in your Railway environment variables
- You need to access the Neon Console to run SQL scripts

---

## üìã Option 1: Get Credentials from Railway (Recommended)

### Step 1: Access Railway Dashboard

1. Go to **https://railway.app**
2. Sign in to your account
3. Find your **getmydpc** project
4. Click on the **backend service** (Node.js/Express)

### Step 2: View Environment Variables

1. In your service, click on the **"Variables"** tab
2. Look for **`DATABASE_URL`**
3. Click to reveal the full value (it's hidden by default)
4. It will look something like this:
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@ep-something-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```

### Step 3: Extract Neon Connection Info

From the DATABASE_URL, you can identify:

**Format:**
```
postgresql://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]/[DATABASE]?sslmode=require
```

**Example:**
```
postgresql://neondb_owner:abc123xyz@ep-cool-rain-a4j8s9d0.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

**Breakdown:**
- **Username**: `neondb_owner`
- **Password**: `abc123xyz`
- **Host**: `ep-cool-rain-a4j8s9d0.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
- **Database**: `neondb`
- **Region**: `us-east-2` (AWS East region)

### Step 4: Access Neon Console

Now that you have the connection details:

1. Go to **https://console.neon.tech**
2. Click **"Sign In"**
3. **Important**: You may need to recover/create your account

---

## üîë Option 2: Find Your Neon Account

### A. Check Your Email

Neon sends emails when databases are created. Search your email for:
- **From**: `neon.tech` or `notifications@neon.tech`
- **Subject**: Contains "project" or "database" or "welcome"
- Look for: Project name, connection details, or sign-in links

### B. Try to Sign In

1. Go to **https://console.neon.tech**
2. Click **"Sign In"**
3. Try signing in with:
   - The email you used for Replit
   - Google OAuth (if you used Google for Replit)
   - GitHub OAuth (if you used GitHub for Replit)

### C. Password Recovery

If you can't sign in:
1. Click **"Forgot password?"**
2. Enter the email you used for Replit
3. Check email for reset link

## üöÄ Option 3: Run SQL Directly from Railway (Quick Solution!)

You can execute the cleanup script **without accessing Neon Console** by running it from your Railway backend!

### Create a One-Time SQL Runner Script:

I can help you create a Node.js script that:
1. Reads the cleanup SQL file
2. Connects to Neon using your existing DATABASE_URL
3. Executes the cleanup
4. Shows you the results
5. Then you delete the script (security)

**Would you like me to create this?** ‚úÖ This is the EASIEST option!

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Option 4: Use SQL via Terminal/PowerShell

If you have PostgreSQL client installed locally:

### Step 1: Get DATABASE_URL from Railway
(Follow Option 1, Steps 1-2 above)

### Step 2: Run SQL from Command Line

```powershell
# Install PostgreSQL client if you don't have it
# Download from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/

# Set the DATABASE_URL
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://username:password@host/database"

# Run the verification script
psql $env:DATABASE_URL -f verify_before_cleanup.sql

# If verification looks good, run cleanup
psql $env:DATABASE_URL -f clean_test_data_keep_last_20.sql
```

## üìä Option 5: Use a GUI Tool (User-Friendly)

### Install pgAdmin or DBeaver:

**pgAdmin** (Most popular):
1. Download: https://www.pgadmin.org/download/
2. Install and open
3. Right-click "Servers" ‚Üí "Register" ‚Üí "Server"
4. **General Tab**: Name = "Neon GetMyDPC"
5. **Connection Tab**: 
   - Host: (from DATABASE_URL)
   - Port: 5432
   - Database: (from DATABASE_URL)
   - Username: (from DATABASE_URL)
   - Password: (from DATABASE_URL)
6. Click "Save"
7. Use the Query Tool to run SQL

**DBeaver** (More modern):
1. Download: https://dbeaver.io/download/
2. Install and open
3. Click "New Database Connection"
4. Select "PostgreSQL"
5. Paste your DATABASE_URL or enter details manually
6. Test connection ‚Üí Finish
7. Right-click database ‚Üí "SQL Editor"
8. Run your scripts

## ‚úÖ My Recommended Approach (Easiest to Hardest)

### **#1 - Node.js Script via Railway (Easiest)** ‚≠ê
- I create a script for you
- You push to Railway
- Run it once via Railway logs
- Delete the script
- **No extra setup needed!**

### **#2 - Get Railway DATABASE_URL ‚Üí Access Neon Console**
- Get credentials from Railway
- Log into Neon Console
- Run SQL in their editor
- Professional, clean interface

### **#3 - Use pgAdmin/DBeaver GUI**
- Install free database client
- Connect with DATABASE_URL
- Visual interface for SQL
- Good for ongoing management

### **#4 - PowerShell/Terminal with psql**
- Install PostgreSQL client
- Run SQL from command line
- Quick but technical

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Will running SQL mess up my app?**
A: The cleanup script is safe and includes verification. Your app will keep working.

**Q: Do I need to stop Railway while running cleanup?**
A: No, Railway can stay running. The cleanup is quick and safe.

**Q: What if I can't find my Neon account?**
A: Use Option 3 (Node.js script) - it doesn't require Neon Console access.
