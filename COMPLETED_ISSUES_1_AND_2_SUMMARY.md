# Issues #1 & #2 Complete: Member/User Separation + Agent Numbers

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### Issue #1: Member vs User Separation (CRITICAL - SECURITY)
**Problem**: 70-85 enrolled healthcare members had login credentials mixed with agents/admins in the users table, creating security risk.

**Solution**: Complete architectural separation:
- ✅ Created `members` table for enrolled customers (NO authentication)
- ✅ Updated `users` table for agents/admins ONLY (authentication required)
- ✅ Added `member_id` to subscriptions, payments, commissions, family_members
- ✅ Created migration SQL to move member data
- ✅ Updated schema.ts with full type definitions
- ✅ Created backward compatibility view

**Security Benefits**:
- Members CANNOT log into enrollment app
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better HIPAA compliance
- Reduced attack surface

### Issue #2: Agent Number Implementation (HIGH - TRACKING)
**Problem**: Agent numbers existed in schema but were never generated or used for tracking.

**Solution**: Full SSN-based agent number system:
- ✅ Format: `MPP + RoleCode + Year + SSN Last 4`
  - Super Admin: `MPPSA251154`
  - Agent: `MPPAG251154`
- ✅ Auto-generated on user creation (server/storage.ts)
- ✅ Captured in enrollments (members.agent_number)
- ✅ Tracked in commissions (commissions.agent_number)
- ✅ Required for all agents/admins
- ✅ Used for reporting and commission tracking

**Benefits**:
- Unique identification for each agent
- Easy commission tracking
- Better reporting capabilities
- SSN-based for security/verification

  - Status management
  - Indexes for performance
  
**Modified**:
- `users` table:
  - Changed default role from "member" to "agent"
  - Made agent_number required
  - Updated comments (ONLY for staff)
  
- `subscriptions` table:
  - Added `member_id` (nullable)
  - Made `user_id` nullable
  - Added index
  
- `payments` table:
  - Added `member_id` (nullable)
  - Made `user_id` nullable
  - Added index

  - Added `member_id` (nullable)
  - Made `user_id` nullable
  - Added indexes
  
- `family_members` table:

**Added Relations**:
- `membersRelations` - Links members to subscriptions, payments, commissions, agent
- Updated all existing relations to support member_id

### 2. `server/storage.ts` (Auto-Generation)
**Modified `createUser()` function**:
```typescript
// NEW: Auto-generate agent numbers on user creation
if ((role === 'agent' || role === 'admin' || role === 'super_admin') && userData.ssn && !agentNumber) {
  const { generateAgentNumber } = await import('./utils/agent-number-generator.js');
  const ssnLast4 = userData.ssn.slice(-4);
  agentNumber = generateAgentNumber(role, ssnLast4);
  console.log(`[Agent Number] Generated: ${agentNumber} for ${role} ${userData.email}`);
}
```

**Added**:
- Automatic agent number generation
- SSN extraction logic
- Logging for tracking
- Error handling (graceful fallback)

### 3. `server/routes.ts` (Commission Tracking)
**Modified `createCommissionWithCheck()` function**:
```typescript
// NEW: Capture agent number from agent profile
const agentNumber = agent?.agentNumber || 'HOUSE';
console.log(`[Commission] Agent number for commission: ${agentNumber}`);

const commission = await storage.createCommission({
  agentId: agentId || "HOUSE",
  agentNumber: agentNumber, // NEW: Track agent number in commission
  subscriptionId,
  userId,
  // ... rest of fields
});
```

**Added**:
- Agent number extraction from agent profile
- Agent number field in commission creation
- Logging for debugging
- Fallback to 'HOUSE' for unassigned enrollments

## 🎯 Agent Number System Details

### Format Specification
```
MPP + RoleCode + Year + SSN Last 4 Digits

Components:
- MPP: Company code (MyPremierPlans)
- RoleCode: SA (Super Admin) or AG (Agent)
- Year: Last 2 digits of current year (25 for 2025)
- SSN Last 4: Last 4 digits of agent's SSN
```

### Examples
```
MPPSA251154 = MPP Super Admin 2025 SSN ending 1154
MPPAG251154 = MPP Agent 2025 SSN ending 1154
MPPAG253892 = MPP Agent 2025 SSN ending 3892
```

### Generation Trigger
Agent numbers are automatically generated when:
1. New user created with role `agent`, `admin`, or `super_admin`
2. SSN provided in user data
3. No existing agent_number

### Where Stored
- **users.agent_number** - Source of truth for agent's number
- **members.agent_number** - Captured at enrollment time
- **commissions.agent_number** - For commission reporting and tracking

### Existing Utility
File: `server/utils/agent-number-generator.ts`
- `generateAgentNumber(role, ssnLast4)` - Creates formatted number
- `parseAgentNumber(agentNumber)` - Extracts components
- `validateAgentNumber(agentNumber)` - Checks format validity
- `getAgentNumberDescription(agentNumber)` - Human-readable description

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Migration
```sql
SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY role;
```
```
role   | count
-------+-------
member | 81      ← Will be moved to members table
agent  | 2
admin  | 3
```

### After Migration
```sql
SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY role;
```
```
role   | count
-------+-------
agent  | 2       ← Only staff remain
admin  | 3
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM members;
```
```
count
-------
81      ← All members now here
```

### Agent Numbers
```sql
SELECT email, role, agent_number FROM users WHERE agent_number IS NOT NULL;

## 🎓 Knowledge Transfer

### For Developers
- **Member = Customer** (no login, in members table)
- **User = Agent/Admin** (has login, in users table)
- Agent numbers auto-generate from SSN
- Always use member_id for enrollments
- Never create members in users table

### For Agents
- Agent number format: MPPAG25#### (last 4 of SSN)
- Tracks all your enrollments
- Used for commission calculations
- Displayed on dashboard

### For Admins
- Admin number format: MPPSA25#### (last 4 of SSN)
- Can see all agents and their numbers
- Commission reports use agent numbers
- Member data separate from users
