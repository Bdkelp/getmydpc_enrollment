# ✅ Lead Form Fix Applied - Ready to Test

## Summary

The lead form was failing because the code was trying to insert columns (`source`, `assigned_agent_id`, `updated_at`) that don't exist in your Supabase `leads` table yet.

## Fix Applied

I've updated the `createLead()` function in `server/storage.ts` to work with the **current** table structure:

### Current Working Columns:
- ✅ `first_name` 
- ✅ `last_name`
- ✅ `email`
- ✅ `phone`
- ✅ `message`
- ✅ `status`
- ✅ `created_at` (auto-generated)

### Code Changes:
The function now only inserts the columns that exist and skips the optional ones that don't exist yet.

## Testing Results

✅ **Test passed!** Lead creation works with current table structure:
```
✅ Lead created successfully!
   Lead ID: 2
   Name: John Doe
   Email: johndoe@example.com
   Status: new
```

## What This Means

**Your public contact form should work NOW!** 

The form will:
1. Accept visitor submissions
2. Store: first name, last name, email, phone, message, status='new'
3. Show up in your admin panel
4. NOT have agent assignment (since that column doesn't exist yet)

## Optional: Add Missing Columns Later

If you want agent assignment functionality later, run this SQL in Supabase:

**File:** `add_missing_leads_columns.sql`

This adds:
- `source` - track where leads come from
- `assigned_agent_id` - assign leads to agents
- `notes` - add notes about leads
- `updated_at` - track when leads are modified

But you don't need these columns for the basic contact form to work!

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the code changes
2. **Deploy to Railway** (auto-deploy or manual)
3. **Test the public contact form** on your website
4. **Check admin panel** - leads should appear

## Testing the Live Form

After deployment, test by:
1. Go to your public website
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Submit
4. Check admin dashboard → Leads section
5. Should see new lead with status='new'

## Status

- ✅ Code fixed (`createLead` function updated)
- ✅ Tested successfully (lead inserted and retrieved)
- ⏳ Needs deployment to Railway
- ⏳ Needs testing on live website

The error should be gone now! 🎉
